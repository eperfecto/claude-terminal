# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Terminal are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The mobile chat folds a run of the same tool into one row with a ×N badge, the
  way the desktop chat already did. A turn that ran six shell commands printed six
  cards and pushed the answer off the screen. Tap the row to see the individual
  calls; it stays open while the rest of the run arrives.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- Opening a session from Control or from the session dropdown showed an empty
  chat until you wrote into it. Only one of the three ways to open a session
  pulled its transcript; all of them go through the same path now.
- Resuming a session listed the conversation twice — once as the original and
  once as the session now carrying it. The entry a session was resumed from is
  retired when the resume happens.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- Restarting the cloud server no longer looks like it deleted your sessions. The
  server kept the metadata and the transcript on disk all along but reported only
  the sessions still running in memory, so the phone pruned the rest from view.
  They now come back marked as resumable, and writing into one continues the
  conversation from its transcript instead of opening a blank session.
- The admin Overview and Users tabs counted sessions left marked `running` by a
  previous process as active. They are reconciled at startup.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- The cloud server image failed to build: the release version file the previous
  version added to `/health` was excluded from the Docker build context, so every
  `docker compose up --build` aborted. Upgrading a self-hosted server to 2.1.0
  was not possible.
- Building the cloud server image from a Windows checkout produced a container
  that died on startup with `exec /entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`.
  Shell scripts are now pinned to LF line endings.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- The mobile remote shows which build the cloud server is running, beside the
  project count. It stays hidden unless the server reports a real version.

### Fixed
- `/health` reported the version of `cloud/package.json`, which nothing bumps —
  it had said `0.2.0` across every release. It now reports the release version
  the server was built from, so the admin Overview tab shows it too.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-10

**Breaking:** the mobile remote no longer connects to your desktop. If you used it
over local Wi-Fi with a PIN, that path is gone — the PWA is now served by, and
talks only to, your self-hosted cloud server.

### Removed
- **Remote UI is cloud-only.** The PWA no longer bridges to the desktop: the relay
  server (`cloud/src/relay/`), the LAN remote server (`RemoteServer.js`), PIN/QR
  pairing and the Remote panel are gone. The phone authenticates with a cloud API
  key and reads only what lives on the cloud server.
- Mobile features the cloud API cannot serve: git pull/push/status, time tracking,
  `@` mentions, image attachments, permission prompts (cloud sessions run with
  `bypassPermissions`) and mid-session model/effort switching — the model and effort
  pickers now apply to the next session.

### Changed
- The desktop's cloud connection indicator is a REST probe of `/api/me` every 60 s
  (`CloudStatusMonitor.js`) instead of the relay socket staying open.
- Cloud sync picks up remote changes on its periodic pull rather than on a relay push.
- The `remote-ui/` PWA is no longer bundled into the desktop installer; the cloud
  server serves it.
